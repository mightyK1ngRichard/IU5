    Electronics Workbench
===================================

Electronics Workbench sets the standard for affordable simulators.
The tight integration of its schematic editor, SPICE simulator and
on-screen waveforms makes what-if scenarios easy and instant.

The full suite of analyses improves your productivity with insights
into the behavior and stability of your designs. The SPICE 3 engine
simulates analog, digital and mixed A/D circuits for exceptional power
and accuracy.

The extensive model library means you'll have the devices you need.
And since Electronics Workbench can share design files with other
simulators and export to PCB layout packages, it fits easily into your
design flow. In short, you'll produce better designs, faster.

The exceptional features of this latest release will come as no
surprise to our 80,000 previous customers. Value, power and ease of
use are what Electronics Workbench has always stood for.

2. Insert the Electronics Workbench Demo CD into your CD drive.

3. For Windows 3.x, from the Program Manager, select File Menu and choose Run;
   Or, from the Start Menu in Windows 95/NT, choose Run.

4. Type z:\setup (where 'z' is your CD drive) and press ENTER.

5. Follow the directions on the display. The Electronics Workbench
   demo will be placed in a directory called EWBDEMO in the root
   directory of drive C, unless you specify a different drive or
   directory.

6. If you are running the demo on Windows 3.1/3.11, then you will also
   need to install Win32s which is also installed on the Demo CD.

NOTE: Installing this version of WIN32S will over-write the previous
      version of WIN32S on your computer. Installation of WIN32S may
      affect the functionality of existing software. If this occurs,
      simply re-install the non-functioning software.
